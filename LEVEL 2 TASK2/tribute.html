                    Maulana Azad's family moved back to Calutta, India when he was young, and he received a traditional Islamic education at home from his father and other Islamic scholars rather than at a madrasah. However, he was also influenced by the emphasis that Indian educator Sir Sayyed Ahmad Khan placed on getting a well-rounded education, and he learned English without his father’s knowledge.
